# ØTick
## The Feather Weight Trading Framework

**ØTick** \zerotick\\:

<span>    **Ø**</span>   Open source, designed for UNIX platforms.<br>
<span>    **Ø**</span>   Language and platform agnostic messaging using ØMQ.<br>
<span>    **Ø**</span>   Documented interfaces using msgpack IDL and RPC.<br>
<span>    **Ø**</span>   Out-of-the-box support for Interactive Broker's TWS API.<br>
<span>    **Ø**</span>   Component discoverability using ØTickNS.<br>


### Ideas

* Proxies for other trading framework components (tradelink.org) so that alternate broker and market data interfaces can be used immediately.
